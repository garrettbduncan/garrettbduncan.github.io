This is a place to practice writing and learning, showcase projects, and keep family up to date. 

- If you're here to catch on posts, see the link "Blog Posts" above at the top of the screen. I enjoy writing about statistics, family adventures, and my hobbies.
- If you want to see projects I've done, click on the "Portfolio" link above.

This site is a work in progress. Don't get too attached to it's appearance, and don't judge my writing too seriously :)
