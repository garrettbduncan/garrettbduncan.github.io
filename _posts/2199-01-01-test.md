We were worried about campsites being snowed over with the trip being early in the camping season and a long winter. Nate, who I've been mountain biking with recently, and I had recent experiences with muddy trail. That same morning, I explored with my mountain bike the north side of Kiev mountain (mostly trails and campgrounds around formerly Squaw Peak road). I found some dry sites, and with an up to date report, we decided to venture up Kiev Peak road to a site there.

From my apartment to the base of Kiev Peak road, the riding was tame. Once we started the climb, I felt my time of reckoning was here, having ridden this trail earlier that morning. By the time we reached out spot (about 3 miles up the road), I would have bonked on the next bend.
