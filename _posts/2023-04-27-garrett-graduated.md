Finally done with 5 years at BYU. Now he's off to spoil Bojangles for the next 2 weeks before starting work.

After 5 years, I finally graduated. It's been a long journey, and I never thought I'd come. I had doubts about what to study in my early years, and even when I discovered statistics, I sometimes thought I wouldn't finish the program. Super grateful I stuck it out.

### Graduation day

Highlights of the day:

- The commencement speakers. Those were killer, and it was amazing to see one of Kevin Worthen's final addresses to BYU.
- Walking across the stage and having my name read. Though I'll say it's not as glamorous as I thought it would be. Didn't know what to expect, but it was just alright I suppose.
- Seeing professors I respect and admire in their PhD robes. This is always cool to me.
- Family coming down for the occasion. I had a lot of family support me, even from the Cannon side, which meant a lot.
- The bagel bar we had afterwards. It was a post-graduation meal for the ages. Dave brought bagels. We brought smoked brisket. My mom made schmears. So good.
- Playing basketball with some Cannons and Duncans. I've always wanted to have mine and Rachel's family ball against each other, and today I saw a glimpse of that. Super fun.
